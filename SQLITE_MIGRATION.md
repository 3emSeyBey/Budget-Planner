# SQLite Migration Complete ✅

## Overview
The Budget Planner has been successfully migrated from MySQL to SQLite for both local development and production environments.

## What Changed

### 1. Database Configuration
- **File**: `lib/database.js`
- **Change**: Now always uses SQLite instead of MySQL
- **Benefit**: Eliminates SSL certificate issues and simplifies deployment

### 2. SQLite Implementation
- **File**: `lib/database-sqlite.js`
- **Features**: 
  - Automatic schema initialization
  - Production-ready with `/tmp` directory support
  - Full compatibility with existing API endpoints

### 3. Database Schema
- **File**: `lib/database-schema-sqlite.sql`
- **Updated**: Added missing `action_plan` column to `weekly_budgets` table
- **Includes**: All 11 budget categories pre-populated

## Environment Support

### Local Development
- Database file: `data/budget_planner.db`
- Automatic creation and initialization
- Persistent data storage

### Production (Vercel)
- Database file: `/tmp/budget_planner.db`
- Serverless-compatible
- Note: Data is not persistent across deployments (resets on each deployment)

## Benefits

✅ **No More SSL Errors**: Eliminated "unable to get local issuer certificate" issues  
✅ **Offline Functionality**: App works completely offline  
✅ **Faster Performance**: Local SQLite is faster than remote database calls  
✅ **Simplified Development**: No need for online database credentials  
✅ **Production Ready**: Works on Vercel serverless functions  

## API Endpoints Working
- ✅ `/api/categories` - Budget categories
- ✅ `/api/budget` - Weekly budget data
- ✅ `/api/expenses` - Expense tracking
- ✅ `/api/smart` - Smart features
- ✅ `/api/analytics` - Analytics data

## Database Structure
```sql
budget_categories (11 categories pre-populated)
weekly_budgets (with action_plan column)
expenses
budget_adjustments
savings_goals
weekly_summaries
```

## Next Steps
The application is now fully functional with SQLite. You can:
1. Start the server: `node server.js`
2. Access the app at: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Deploy to Vercel for production use

## Production Considerations
For production deployments where data persistence is critical, consider:
- Using a cloud SQLite service like Turso
- Implementing data backup/restore functionality
- Using external storage for the SQLite file
